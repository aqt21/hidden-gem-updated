						<h2> The Problem </h2>
						
						<p> It's become increasingly difficult to find new things to do around town when current search results are dominated by the top dogs. 
							Searching on places such as Google or Yelp will always return the same results.
							In Seattle, when searching for "top 10 things to do in Seattle" the results are flooded with tourist attractions such as the Space Needle, Pike Place Market, and the Seattle Art Museum.
							Of course these attractions are great but they can get old to people who have already done them.
							Meanwhile, there are many places in Seattle worth seeing and experiencing that are hard to find through usual search results.

						<h2> Our Solution </h2>
						
						<p> Our solution is to compile a list of all of the "hidden gems" in the Pacific Northwest. 
							Our database and presentation of our information will make it easy for our users to get past all the touristy attractions and find new things to do.
							Things such as "Paint the Town" in U-Village, Vance Creek Bridge in Shelton, and many others attractions will gain exposure.
							Our goal is to help the unknown but beautiful and fun attractions in the Pacific Northwest get the attention they deserve.
